Date-Nite is a blind dating application designed through the use of Rails, Javascript, React and Redux. There is a frontend that consists of React and Redux and a backend that consists of Rails. The app uses a redux store that can communicate with the rails API to fire fetch requests and receive back responses thus updating the store, ultimately controlling the state of the application.
