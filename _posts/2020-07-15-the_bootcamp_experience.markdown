It's been a long road, but I am finally here. After almost a year of being enrolled, I can now say I finsihed m fullstack web-development bootcamp. What seemed like a lifetime away last August is now last week. Where do I even begin? 

It all started last July, when I received my first email regarding orientation. A meeting invetation was attached and nearly 100 students were on a call together asking questions ranging from what time is class from what career opportunities we would have once we finished. Of course we were all on a Zoom call, which now in the age of Covid has become fairly standardized, but at the time remote learning was foreign to me. I never had online lectures or video conferences before. It was amazing, there were people from all over the world on the same call as me. I felt bad for the people in the U.K. though since it was roughly midnight for them. 

Anyway, soon after all of the students who were preparing to enter were sent a link to access their pre-course work. There were more labs than you may have expected ranging from html, ruby, css, etc.. the recommendation was to work consistently to complete all the labs. 

Fast forward a month, and we were live. August 12th 2019, remember the date, was the official beginning of the 40 week course load. There were surprisingly less students than those that had started off in the orientation program. The cohort along with the many students also had a cohort lead and a educational coach. Our cohort lead was, Jake, a quirky young individual who enjoyed Latin and Gregorian chants. Our educational coach, Etan, was somewhat of an enigma since I didn't necessarily meet with him all that often. Both moved on from Flatiron during the bootcamp, but I can elaborate on the many departures throughout the journey of cohort pt-onlne-08-12-19. 

More to come..
